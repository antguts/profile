<h2>ZOMBIE KARENS!</h2>

<h3>-THE GAME-</h3>
<p>You are having a nice day at the local park when you feel a dark presence. Screeches suddenly ring out of the woods, filled with the anger
of a thousand manager requests. As the crys become louder you realize you're surrounded by Karens, not just any Karens.....Zombie Karens!</p>

<b>The goal of this game is to eliminate the wave of Karens by using your mouse to point and shoot. See how quickly you can make it through the game. Try to improve your times! Be careful though, a super Karen has been seen lurking around somewhere.</b>
